This is the algortihm for Depth First Search in a given graph.

-We take a starting vertex , and push all its adjacent vertexes in a stack.
-Now we pop an element from a stack and push all its vertexes in the stack , and we also mark down these vertexes as visited.
-After executing the code, we will get the vertex visited in a depth first manner.
