This is the algortihm for Breadth First Search in a given graph.

-We take a starting vertex , and push all its adjacent vertexes in a queue.
-Now we pop an element from a queue and push all its vertexes in the queue , and we also mark down these vertexes as visited.
-After executing the code, we will get the vertex visited in a breadth first manner.
