The 2 different programs in this folder contain the same implementation!
The programs basically are a python implementation of the Catalan Numbers.
They're similar to Fibonacci (very slightly)

The 2 different implementations vary only in terms of time taken!<br>
Basically we can implement in 3 different ways!<br>

(1) Recursively <br>
(2) Dynamic Programming <br>
(3) Binomial Coefficient <br><br>

Each of the above 3 implementations have a descending order of time complexities from (1) to (3) <br><br>

For (1) the time complexity is exponential<br>
For (2) the time complexity is O(n^2)<br>
For (3) the time complexity is O(n)<br><br>

The Binomial implementation has the best time complexity while the Recursive implementation has the worst time complexity<br>
In this folder we have the Binomial and Recursive implementations of Catalan Numbers.<br><br>
